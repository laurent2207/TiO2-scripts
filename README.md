I have stored the previously odd restults in the [odd-results folder](https://github.com/laurent2207/TiO2-scripts/tree/master/Odd_results). 
In this folder are also the annotated gene files I have used in the enricher function.

In the folder [R-scripts](https://github.com/laurent2207/TiO2-scripts/tree/master/R-scripts) there are the new results. I have only used the [common_genes.R](https://github.com/laurent2207/TiO2-scripts/blob/master/R-scripts/common_genes.R) script and the [Overrepres.R](https://github.com/laurent2207/TiO2-scripts/blob/master/R-scripts/Overrepres.R) scripts. 

In the [common_genes.R](https://github.com/laurent2207/TiO2-scripts/blob/master/R-scripts/common_genes.R) script, I use a [self made function](https://github.com/laurent2207/TiO2-scripts/blob/master/R-scripts/functions/GO_annotation.R) to annotate the HGNC-symbols to entrezgene identifiers, this function is stored in the [functions folder](https://github.com/laurent2207/TiO2-scripts/tree/master/R-scripts/functions).
