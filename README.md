# Workflow

## How to run
This workflow can entirely be run in the [workflow.R script](https://github.com/laurent2207/TiO2-scripts/blob/master/workflow.R). The necessary data files are already pre-processed and can be found in the [data-output folder](https://github.com/laurent2207/TiO2-scripts/tree/master/data/data-output) in the [data folder](https://github.com/laurent2207/TiO2-scripts/tree/master/data). The [workflow.R script](https://github.com/laurent2207/TiO2-scripts/blob/master/workflow.R) loads in these pre-processed files and the script can be used from the onset.
